### Introduction to Basic Functions in JavaScript 🚀

#### What We Will Learn
- The importance of functions.
- How to create and call basic functions.

#### Why We Need Functions 🤔
Functions help solve the problem of code repetition. Without functions, you might end up writing the same code multiple times, making your codebase larger and harder to maintain.

Example Problem Without Functions:
```javascript
console.log("Hello World");
console.log("Hello World");
console.log("Hello World");
// This repeats the same line multiple times.
```

Using a function, we can simplify this:
```javascript
function printHelloWorld() {
    console.log("Hello World");
}

// Now we can call the function multiple times
printHelloWorld();
```

#### Creating a Basic Function 🔨
In JavaScript, you define a function using the `function` keyword. Here's a basic function:
```javascript
function printHelloWorld() {
    console.log("Hello World");
}
```
This function, named `printHelloWorld`, outputs "Hello World" to the console.

#### Calling the Function 📞
To execute the function, you simply call it by its name followed by parentheses:
```javascript
printHelloWorld(); // Output: Hello World
```
This function can be called as many times as needed, demonstrating the concept of code reusability.


#### Why Use Functions? 
Functions help organize code into manageable sections. They allow us to perform specific tasks multiple times without rewriting the same code.

#### Remember 🌟
- Functions are building blocks in JavaScript, making your code more modular and organized.
- A well-named function makes your code easier to read and maintain.
- Practice is key to mastering functions, so try creating and calling your own simple functions.
